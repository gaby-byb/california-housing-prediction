# California Housing Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

A machine learning project predicting median housing values from the California Housing dataset.  
Built with **Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib**.

---

## Project Overview

- Preprocessed housing dataset.
- Created income categories for **stratified train/test split**.
- Built regression model with evaluation metrics (RMSE).

---

## ⚙️ Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaby-byb/california-housing-prediction
cd california-housing-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## ▶️ Run the Code

1. Launch Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open eda.ipynb
3. Run all cells

## Results

Example output:

- RMSE: ~68,000

- Insights: Income is the strongest predictor of housing value.
